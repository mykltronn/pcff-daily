# A React Daily Project from TIY

## A small react debugging exercise  

### Good example of:
- using a non-self-closing tag to render a child:
- -- e.g. <BaseLayout> other stuff <BaseLayout />
- and then using {this.props.children} to tell the child to expect other elements and tell it where to put 'em.
